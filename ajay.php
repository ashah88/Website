<h1>Ajay's Thoughts</h1>

<ol>What is next:
    <li>Tuesday: What would movies and shows be like if they were unscripted?</li>
    <li>Wednesday: Do computers track everything you say?</li>
    <li>Thursday: Do people go to resturants or just take food to go?</li>
    
</ol>
<h2 class="text-primary">Tuesday: What Would Movies be Like if They Were Unscripted?</h2>
<p>We watch movies and tv shows everyday, but what if they were unscripted? To be honest, I think that it would depend on what type of movie it was. If it were an action movie then it would be funy to watch the characters do things that would require a stunt man. If it were a reality tv show, then it would stayt the same but the plot would be very different.</p>
