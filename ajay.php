    <li class="text-secondary">Tuesday: What would movies and shows be like if they were unscripted?</li>
    <li class="text-secondary">Wednesday: Do people go to resturants or just take food to go?</li>
    
</ol>
<h2 class="text-primary">Tuesday: What Would Movies be Like if They Were Unscripted?</h2>
<p class="text-primary">We watch movies and tv shows everyday, but what if they were unscripted? To be honest, I think that it would depend on what type of movie it was. If it were an action movie then it would be funy to watch the characters do things that would require a stunt man. If it were a reality tv show, then it would stayt the same but the plot would be very different.</p>

<h2 class="text-success">Wednesday: Do People go to Resturants any More?</h2>
<p class="text-success">Last week I went to resturant for dinner with my family. This resutrant is a popular one so we made a resurvation two days before. We arrived about 20 minutes before our secudaled reservation and let us in. However, the last I had come top this resturant we had to wait a couple minutes to get a seat. This resurant gets busy around 7-8 p.m. we left at 7:50 p.m. and half of the place was deserted. I did see that lots of people were crowed around the front desk. I guessed tthey wanted to take food out because there was a lot of open tables for the people. This got me thinking if people have the time and if they want to spend time with there family and eat dinner with them. </p>

<h2 class="text-muted">Thursday: Why did Stan Lee Name Some of His Comic Characters With the Same First Letter of its First Name and Last Name? </h2>
<p class="text-muted">Have you ever noticed that some of Stan Lee's comic characters have the same first letter in their first and last name. Ex. Bruce Banner, Steven Strange, Pepper Potts, Peter Parker...   There has to something linked or maybe he wanted us to notice this like it was an easter egg in video games. </p>

<h2 class="text-warning">Friday: Would You Rather Read a Real Book or an E-Book? What do you think? Send a comment to share your opinion.</h2>
